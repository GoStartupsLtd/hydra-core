LT Blockchain

===================



Intro

-----

LT is a decentralized blockchain project built on Bitcoin's UTXO model, with support for Ethereum Virtual Machine based smart contracts, and secured by a proof of stake consensus model. It achieves this through the revolutionary Account Abstraction Layer which allows the EVM to communicate with LT's Bitcoin-like UTXO blockchain.
