How to Upgrade
==============

If you are running an older version, shut it down. Wait until it has completely
shut down (which might take a few minutes for older versions), then run the 
installer (on Windows) or just copy over `/Applications/LockTrip-Qt` (on Mac)
or `locktripd`/`locktrip-qt` (on Linux).

The first time you run version 0.15.3 or higher, your chainstate database will
be converted to a new format, which will take anywhere from a few minutes to
half an hour, depending on the speed of your machine.

Compatibility
==============

LockTrip is extensively tested on multiple operating systems using
the Linux kernel, macOS 10.8+, and Windows Vista and later. Windows XP is not supported.

LockTrip should also work on most other Unix-like systems but is not
frequently tested on them.
