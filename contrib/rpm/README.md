RPM Spec File Notes
-------------------

The RPM spec file provided here is for LockTrip 0.15.3 and builds on CentOS
7 with either the CentOS provided OpenSSL library or with LibreSSL as packaged
at [LibreLAMP.com](https://librelamp.com/). It should hopefully not be too
difficult to port the RPM spec file to most RPM based Linux distributions.
